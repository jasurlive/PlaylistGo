## 📁 How It Works

1. **Excel Sheet as Playlist**  
   The app reads an Excel (`public/python/songs.xlsx`) file where each row represents a song with details like:

   - `Song Name`
   - `Artist`
   - `YouTube Link`

2. **YouTube Search**  
   If no direct link is provided, the app will automatically search YouTube using the song name and artist, and play the best result.

3. **Music Player UI**  
   Simple and intuitive player interface with custom playlist support.
